TRUTH - project_template (TRUTH_V13)
==================================================

LOCKED PRE
- Confirm-without-bump is single-shot:
  - When mint_truth offers "Mark latest TRUTH_Vn as [CONFIRM] (no version bump)" and user answers yes:
    - set header type to [CONFIRM]
    - ensure required POST artifacts exist for that same version:
      - FULL truth zip
      - SLIM truth zip
      - before_confirm marker points to a readable backup zip
    - run doctor(post)
    - on failure: exit once with a clear summary (no crashes, no silent success)

- Implementation constraints:
  - artifact creation MUST use canonical config + repo_walk enumerator (no ad-hoc globbing)
  - validators and doctor MUST continue to emit explicit OK lines and support stable --json

LOCKED POST
- Confirming a truth never requires manual zip rebuilding
- A single run of tools\mint_truth.ps1 is sufficient to reach "doctor(post) OK" after confirming
