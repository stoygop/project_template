TRUTH - project_template (TRUTH_V10)
==================================================

LOCKED PRE
- Confirm-draft produces a before_confirm backup zip and records the exact zip path deterministically.
- A machine-readable marker is written after backup creation/validation to:
  _truth/last_before_confirm_backup.json
- Marker contains absolute zip path and timestamp.

LOCKED POST
- doctor --phase post enforces deterministic backup validation:
  - If marker exists: validate the exact backup zip referenced; missing/invalid hard-fails.
  - If marker does not exist: emit explicit OK message (no silent skip).
- validate_backup_zip accepts str/pathlike inputs (no confirm-draft crash on path types).
- No "best effort newest backup" guessing is used for backup validation.
