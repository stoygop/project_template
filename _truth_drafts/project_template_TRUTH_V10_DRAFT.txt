TRUTH - project_template (TRUTH_V10)
==================================================

LOCKED

- confirm-draft now records the exact before_confirm backup it creates:
  - A machine-readable marker is written to:
    _truth/last_before_confirm_backup.json
  - Marker contains absolute zip path and timestamp
  - Marker is written only after backup creation and validation

- doctor --phase post enforces backup validation deterministically:
  - If the marker exists:
    - The exact backup zip referenced MUST be validated
    - Missing or invalid backup hard-fails doctor
  - If the marker does not exist:
    - doctor emits an explicit OK message (no silent skip)

- Backup validation is path-safe and consistent:
  - validate_backup_zip accepts str and Path inputs
  - confirm-draft no longer crashes due to path type mismatches

- confirm-draft / doctor behavior is now non-guessing:
  - No "best effort newest backup" logic remains
  - No silent skipping of backup validation is permitted
