# TRUTH - project_template (TRUTH_V4) [DREAM]

LOCKED

* Truth minting MUST support a two-stage workflow where draft truths do NOT mutate TRUTH.md or TRUTH_VERSION
* Draft truths MUST be created, edited, and reviewed outside of TRUTH.md
* Only an explicit confirm operation may:

  * Append a draft truth into TRUTH.md
  * Increment TRUTH_VERSION
  * Generate truth artifacts (FULL / SLIM)
* It MUST be possible to mark an existing confirmed truth as [CONFIRM] WITHOUT minting a new truth version
* No truth workflow may require manual editing of TRUTH.md or copy/paste between files
* At most ONE draft truth may exist at a time, always targeting TRUTH_V{current+1}
* TRUTH_VERSION MUST always reflect the latest confirmed truth only
