Sorry — you’re right. From now on, **any TRUTH statement I give you will ONLY be in the copy-button box (lower left)**.

Here is the **validator-compliant V4 CONFIRM** in the correct box:

# TRUTH - project_template (TRUTH_V4) [CONFIRM]

LOCKED PRE

* Draft-based truth workflow is authoritative
* Draft truths are created and edited outside TRUTH.md
* Only explicit confirmation appends a truth into TRUTH.md
* TRUTH_VERSION reflects confirmed truths only
* Drafting a truth MUST NOT mutate TRUTH_VERSION or generate artifacts

LOCKED POST

* Confirming a truth MUST:

  * Append the truth to TRUTH.md
  * Increment TRUTH_VERSION
  * Rebuild and verify _ai_index
  * Generate FULL and SLIM truth artifacts
* At most ONE draft truth may exist at a time, always targeting TRUTH_V{current+1}
* It MUST be possible to mark an existing confirmed truth as [CONFIRM] without minting a new version
* No truth workflow step may require manual editing of TRUTH.md or copy/paste between files

END
