TRUTH - project_template (TRUTH_V12)
==================================================

LOCKED PRE
- Confirm flow correctness:
  - "Mark latest as [CONFIRM] (no version bump)" MUST also ensure required POST artifacts exist for that same version:
    - FULL truth zip
    - SLIM truth zip
    - latest before_confirm backup marker pointing to a readable zip
  - This confirm flow MUST be single-shot:
    - either completes and leaves repo verifiable under doctor(post)
    - or hard-fails once with a clear summary and leaves repo unchanged / rollback-complete

- Doctor ergonomics:
  - tools.doctor MUST support stable --json output
  - doctor output MUST include explicit OK/FAIL events for each sub-step (verify_truth, app.main, etc.)

LOCKED POST
- Confirming a truth never requires manual zip rebuilding
- A single `powershell -File tools\mint_truth.ps1` run is sufficient to reach "doctor(post) OK" when confirming
