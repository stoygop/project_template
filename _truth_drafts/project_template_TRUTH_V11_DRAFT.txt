TRUTH - project_template (TRUTH_V11)
==================================================

LOCKED PRE

- Rollback hardening:
  - confirm-draft rollback must be provably crash-proof
  - rollback paths must not reference undefined symbols
  - rollback must restore repo to a verifiable state or hard-fail once with a clear summary

- Canonical enumerator enforcement hardening:
  - All repo enumeration (repo_map, ai_index, truth zips, backups) must route through repo_walk
  - Verifiers must enumerate and report any deviations explicitly
  - AST parsing in verifiers must be BOM-safe (no manual cleanup required)

- Validator maturity:
  - All validators must emit explicit OK lines on success
  - All validators must support stable --json output
  - doctor(post) must validate:
    - FULL truth zip
    - SLIM truth zip
    - latest before_confirm backup via marker

LOCKED POST

- No silent success paths remain in verification or rollback logic
- confirm-draft failure states are always diagnosable from a single run
