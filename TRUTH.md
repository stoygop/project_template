==================================================
TRUTH - project_template (TRUTH_V1)
==================================================

LOCKED
- Version: 1
- Truth history reset: prior TRUTH entries removed by explicit decision
- Doctor supports explicit phases: `python -m tools.doctor --phase pre|post`
- CI runs doctor in PRE phase: `python -m tools.doctor --phase pre`
- Truth minting is one-command and prompts for TRUTH text in-terminal; terminator is END
- Minting auto-commits any pre-mint dirty working tree state (one-click workflow)
- _ai_index generation is cross-platform deterministic (LF output; no CRLF/LF byte drift)
- Repository enforces LF via .gitattributes for text files that affect verification/indexing

STATEMENT
- This TRUTH intentionally restarts project_template truth history at V1.
- All prior TRUTH content is considered harvested and superseded by this reset.

NOTES
- Next: define and implement phased TRUTH format (LOCKED PRE / LOCKED POST) and migrate forward in new history.

END
