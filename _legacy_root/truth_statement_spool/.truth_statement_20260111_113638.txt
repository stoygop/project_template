TRUTH - project_template (TRUTH_V2) [CONFIRM]
=============================================

LOCKED PRE
- This repo is now in a reseeded D-epoch
- TRUTH.md is authoritative and starts at TRUTH_V1 in the new phased format
- Legacy truth history is archived and must not participate in verification or contiguity checks
- Truth input terminates on a standalone END line (no Ctrl+Z / EOF semantics)
- Pre-artifact verification MUST NOT check for FULL/SLIM existence
- Post-artifact verification MUST require FULL/SLIM existence and correct naming for the minted truth number
- Single authoritative version: app/version.py defines integer TRUTH_VERSION and matches the active TRUTH number

LOCKED POST
- TRUTH_LEGACY.md exists (or legacy truth history is otherwise quarantined) and is excluded from verification
- tools/verify_truth enforces phased truth structure and D-phase correctness
- tools/truth_manager mint order is phase-correct:
  1) harmonize version
  2) pre-verify (no artifact checks)
  3) build ai_index
  4) write TRUTH entry
  5) emit FULL/SLIM
  6) post-verify (artifact checks)
