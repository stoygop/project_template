TRUTH - project_template (TRUTH_V2)
==================================================

LOCKED
- TRUTH_VERSION is an integer and the single authoritative truth version
- TRUTH_VERSION is stored only in app/version.py
- Minting a truth MUST require explicit user approval before incrementing version
- Minting MUST increment TRUTH_VERSION exactly by +1
- Minting MUST always produce FULL and SLIM zip artifacts on success
- Truth statement input MUST terminate on a standalone line `END` (sentinel-based)
- EOF / Ctrl+Z based termination is forbidden
- Minting MUST fail fast and loudly on version or format errors
- Truth header parsing MUST tolerate UTF-8 BOM and CRLF/LF differences

STATE
- tools/mint_truth.ps1 reads truth input line-by-line until `END`
- Truth statement files are written UTF-8 without BOM
- tools/truth_manager.py strips BOM before header validation
- Version parsing does not assume TRUTH_V-prefixed strings
- Version increment and artifact creation are atomic (no partial mint)

NOTES
- This truth formalizes integer-only versioning and END-sentinel input
- Header parsing hardening prevents Windows paste/encoding failures
- Any remaining EOF-based input handling or fragile header parsing is invalid
