TRUTH - project_template (TRUTH_V3)
==================================================

LOCKED
- Minting MUST rebuild and verify _ai_index as part of every successful truth mint
- tools/truth_manager.py MUST call tools.verify_ai_index.main() using its actual signature (no argv if unsupported)
- Minting MUST fail fast and loudly if _ai_index rebuild/verify fails
- Successful mint MUST still produce FULL and SLIM zips after _ai_index passes

STATE
- tools/truth_manager.py no longer passes argv into verify_ai_index.main() when it takes no parameters
- _ai_index rebuild/verify remains mandatory during mint

NOTES
- This truth locks the mint pipeline integration with verify_ai_index and prevents signature mismatch regressions
