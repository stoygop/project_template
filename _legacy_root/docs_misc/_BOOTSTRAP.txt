_BOOTSTRAP — project_template orientation

This file is intended for “zip-first” workflows: when you (or an assistant) are handed a TRUTH zip, read this first.

Repository invariants
- TRUTH_VERSION is authoritative and stored as an integer in app/version.py
- TRUTH.md is append-only history (each TRUTH_V<N> entry is immutable)
- Mints produce TWO zips (FULL + SLIM) in _truth/
- FULL includes assets; SLIM excludes assets + exception folders
- AI index lives in _ai_index/ (no ai-index zip required)

One-liners (PowerShell)
- Mint next Truth:
  cd "C:\Users\stoyg\Documents\Programming\project_template"
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\tools\mint_truth.ps1

- New project from template:
  cd "C:\Users\stoyg\Documents\Programming\project_template"
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\tools\new_project.ps1 -NewName test_project

- Truth Manager GUI:
  cd "C:\Users\stoyg\Documents\Programming\project_template"
  python -m tools.truth_gui

- Doctor (cross-platform):
  cd "C:\Users\stoyg\Documents\Programming\project_template"
  python -m tools.doctor

- AI index:
  cd "C:\Users\stoyg\Documents\Programming\project_template"
  python -m tools.ai_index build
  python -m tools.verify_ai_index

Assistant response contract (non-negotiable)
- Before making code changes: mint a new Truth (or confirm the Truth that authorizes the work).
- When inspecting files: open/read the FULL file contents (no truncated/ellipsis summaries).
- Deliverables for code changes:
  - a patch zip (modified files only)
  - PowerShell commands to extract + run
  - Truth statement in the correct project Truth format (if minting)
- Do not claim a patch exists unless the zip was actually produced from inspected files.
