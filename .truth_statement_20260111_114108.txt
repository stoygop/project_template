TRUTH - project_template (TRUTH_V2) [CONFIRM]
=============================================

LOCKED PRE
- D-epoch is active; TRUTH.md uses phased truths with explicit type tags
- Truth header MAY include exactly one type tag: [CONFIRM|DREAM|DEBUG]
- Header parsing MUST accept optional type tags without breaking contiguity or validation
- Truth minting MUST accept and preserve the declared type verbatim
- Legacy truths are quarantined and excluded from all validation and contiguity logic

LOCKED POST
- tools/truth_manager accepts headers of the form:
  TRUTH - <project> (TRUTH_V#) [TYPE]
- tools/verify_truth validates presence and correctness of TYPE when phases are required
- Truth minting for V2 succeeds without header-regex failure
- FULL and SLIM artifacts are generated only after successful header + phase validation

END
