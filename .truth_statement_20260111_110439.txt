TRUTH - project_template (TRUTH_V2)
==================================================

LOCKED
- TRUTH_VERSION is an integer and is the single authoritative truth version
- TRUTH_VERSION is stored only in app/version.py
- Minting a truth MUST require explicit user approval before incrementing version
- Minting MUST increment TRUTH_VERSION exactly by +1
- Minting MUST always produce FULL and SLIM zip artifacts on success
- Minting MUST fail fast and loudly on version parse errors (no silent failure)

STATE
- tools/mint_truth.ps1 prompts for approval before minting
- Version parsing no longer assumes TRUTH_V-prefixed strings
- Minting aborts cleanly if TRUTH_VERSION cannot be determined
- Version increment and artifact creation are coupled (no partial mint)

NOTES
- This truth formalizes integer-only versioning and approval-gated minting
- Any remaining TRUTH_V string parsing elsewhere is invalid and must be removed
